# My Session: Designing Dedicated Sql Pools for Scale and Performance
Deploying a Dedicated SQL Pool in the cloud is easy, however so is misusing its distributed SQL engine. How do you know you're getting the most DWUs for your Azure spend, could queries run faster, am I writing optimized SQL, how does Synapse even work under the hood?

In this session I'll guide you through the key tenants of building a lightning fast Synapse Dedicated SQL Pool. From table distributions, indexes, statistics, database settings, data movement patterns, to SQL constructs, this session will teach you the options available, pitfalls to avoid, and showcase the impact via industry standard benchmarks.
